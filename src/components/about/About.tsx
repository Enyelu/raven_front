            Hire humans with great attitudes. A brilliant engineer who can’t
            work well as part of a larger team is far less valuable than a
            competent engineer who’s eager to participate with their colleagues
            to ship great software. You also need a clear hiring plan. Connect
            the goals of the business to specific engineering needs that need to
            be filled. At Drift, we prefer to have many small engineering teams
            of three people that can fully own a product or feature. When new
            business needs are identified, we can follow this pattern to define
            exactly what engineering needs will have to be met in order to
            achieve those objectives. As everyone in Boston knows, it is a very
            competitive market for software engineers. Most of the talented
            people already have jobs. Getting them to join your team requires
            showing them that there is a real opportunity to work on great
            technology with amazing people, while growing their career and
            perfecting their craft. We love to showcase the culture and
            opportunity that exists here by hosting both internal and external
            events. Internally, we’ve recently had success with a multi-day
            hackathon that allowed all of our teams to create anything they
            could imagine. Externally, we’ve continued to open up our office
            space as a venue for local meetups and events like Boston Node,
            Product Hunt and others. These events give engineers in Boston a
            chance to understand more about what Drift is like. Hire humans with
